# Section 08

- The @Autowired annotation tells to Spring that he needs to inject the parameter in the constructor automatically.
- If the class who uses the @Autowired on the constructor has only one of it, the annotation is opcional.
- It can also be used on setters and methods, to fullfill the dependecies.
