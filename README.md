# Welcome to my repository!
## This was made to put away the files created from a Udemy Spring Course.
The course teaches Spring & Hibernate, you check it out here: https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/learn/lecture/5165294

## Each branche referes to all topics covered in a section. Each section name can be found above.
## The master branche contains the current program.
## In front of every commit message you can see the commit category:
- CR stands for create: file(s) was created.
- UP stand for update: file(s) was updated.
- DL stands for deleted: file(s) was deleted.
- ALL : at least one change for each category was made.
A commit can also have 2 cateogories at once. In that case, you'll see both of them separeted by a & character. 
i.e.: CR&UP: some files was created and others updated.

# Section 3: Setting Up Development Environment
> Inserting JAR files.
